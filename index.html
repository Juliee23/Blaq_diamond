    <h1 class="heading">About The Author</h1>

        <p>Hey there! I'm Julie and I'm a die hard fan of <b>Blaq_Diamond</b>. I often find myself relating so much with local artists as it hits home when the song is sung in vernacular. The first song I fell inlove with was "ibhanoyi" by Blaq Diamond from their album back in 2019, <em><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaq_Diamond" target="_blank" class="link">"Umuthi"</a></b></em>, as I dedicated it to my then 5month  old son, as she would dance along so much whenever I would stream and sing along, since then, I've been a fan. In this article, I'll be discussing some of my favourite albums and top songs. Let me not keep you waiting and let's get into it.</p>

I loved it. <b><em>Emzini Kababa</em></b> and <b><em> Sthandwa</em></b>, are some pretty uplifting songs, like <em class="link"><q><b>Isoka</b></q></em>.</p>

        <p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaq_Diamond" target="_blank" class="link">Zulu Romance</a></b> is one of my other favourite albums, What I love about this album is: Its album cover. It is filled with happy songs, take for example: <b><em>Qoma</em></b> & <b><em>Away</em></b> & <b><em>Mangibona Wena</em></b> What more could I ask for?</p>

    <h1 class="heading">Top 5 songs</h1>
      <p>I honestly would say every single song by Blaq_Diamond is my favourite, I can't choose! "Nobody said it was easy" and I agree. Almost every song by them brings me joy and I can't say that there is one that I dislike. I tried my best picking out my favourite songs. Do enjoy.</p>

      <h3>5. Summer Yomuthi</h3>
      <p>This song has such an amazing, upbeat vibe to it. Strangely, every time I listen to <em>Summer yomuthi</em>, I remember that when a person works hard for their succes, others will want to reap the benefits for free. </p>

        <h3>4. ibhanoyi</h3>
      <p>This song has an upbeat tune that gets me in the mood of happiness. Not only does it refer to my favourite, but it is just enjoyable to listen to. I love the acoustic version so much. Just need to find a park, where there are lots of birds or nature and just tune in. Its beyond relaxing!</p>

        <h3>3. Away</h3>
      <p> Goosebumps have a way of finding me when I hear this song. It has an element, a hint of, should I say, can't explain.. I  Just love it!  </p>

        <h3>2. Isoka</h3>
      <p>No words can express how much I love this song. The melody, guitar and vocals are quite enjoyable and captivating. Think about the ways mojolo is nyising, its huge, vast and isolated! </p>

      <h3>1. Love Letter</h3>
      <p>All I'm going to say is: just go outside, listen out for the birds, smell the flowers, look at the sky, smell the air, find comfort in nature, in Mother Earth. Appreciate the Earth and those you love. One more thing, don't panic! Just Meditate.</p>
